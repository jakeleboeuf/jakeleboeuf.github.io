You found me. I’m Jake– currently working as a senior software engineer at [Fuzzco](http://fuzzco.com). I like to think I'm a pretty nice guy. I've never been fired. Nobody has ever broken up with me. And only one person has ever tried to sue me, so that's pretty good?

I live in Charleston, SC and spend my days with my wife, surfing small waves, chasing my kids, and [making the internet](http://github.com/jakeleboeuf). I write about code over [here]({{ "/blog" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and if you like me, you can [follow me](http://twitter.com/jakeleboeuf). Or if you want to work on something neat together, [get in touch](mailto:dev@jakeleboeuf.com)!

I only work with [nice people]({{ "/clients" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
