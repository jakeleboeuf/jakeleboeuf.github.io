You found me. I’m Jake– recently joined the party over at [Real Thread](https://realthread.com) as Director of Engineering. [Come work with me](https://www.realthread.com/about#careers)!

I like to think I'm a pretty nice guy. I've never been fired. Nobody has ever broken up with me. And only one person has ever tried to sue me, so that's pretty good?

I live in Charleston, SC and spend my days with my [wife](http://culturedstyle.com), surfing small waves with my [friend](http://davidstanfieldis.me), chasing my kids, and [building the internet](http://github.com/jakeleboeuf). I might write about [things I'm learning]({{ "/blog" | prepend: site.url }}) from time to time– and if you like me, you can [follow me](http://twitter.com/jakeleboeuf).

If you want to work on something neat together, [get in touch](mailto:dev@jakeleboeuf.com)! I only work with [nice people]({{ "/clients" | prepend: site.url }}).
