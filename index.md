You found me. I’m Jake– currently making internets at [Real Thread](https://realthread.com) as Director of Engineering. [Come work with me](https://www.realthread.com/about#careers)!

I like to think I'm a pretty nice guy. I've never been fired. Nobody has ever broken up with me. And only one person has ever tried to sue me, so that's pretty good?

I live in Charleston, SC and spend my days with my [wife](instagram.com/danaleb), surfing small waves with my [friend](http://davidstanfieldis.me), chasing my kids, and [building the internet](http://github.com/jakeleboeuf). I once wrote about [things I've learned]({{ "/blog" | prepend: site.url }}), but that was short lived. And if you like me, you can [follow me](http://twitter.com/jakeleboeuf).

If you want to work on something neat together, [get in touch](mailto:dev@jakeleboeuf.com) or [see if I'm qualified](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-leboeuf-a9486813/)! I only work with [nice people]({{ "/clients" | prepend: site.url }}).
