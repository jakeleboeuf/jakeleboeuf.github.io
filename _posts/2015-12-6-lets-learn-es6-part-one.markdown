I’m finally getting serious about moving over to an ES6 workflow. And along the way I’m share some of the little things I learning as I go.

So for starters, *ES6 is not quite ready for the world just yet*. But that doesn't mean we cant start using it– we'll just need a js compiler. For this series, I'll be using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and  [Webpack ES6 Demo](https://github.com/rauschma/webpack-es6-demo) from Alex Rauschma.

####Just do this, and have a great day!
{% highlight javascript %}
(function($){
  // Oh man, so many codes! 
}(jQuery));
{% endhighlight %}

Hopefuly you want to understand what's happening behind the scenes– [Greg Franko](https://twitter.com/GregFranko) does a great job explaining why [he loves his iife](http://gregfranko.com/blog/i-love-my-iife/), and gives some great examples of how we can use them to make our lives better.
