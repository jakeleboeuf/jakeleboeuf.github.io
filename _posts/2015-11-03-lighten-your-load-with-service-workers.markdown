I've finally decided it's time to be a big boy and learn more about service workers. Something I should have done a long time ago. So if your like me and have been putting off this new technology, just go for it. Get your hands dirty and add a little Service Worker magic to our projects.

<br>

### Service Workers? WTF?
Service workers are a new technology to aid developers in:

- creating realistic, reliable offline experiences
- vastly improving performance when online
- logically and dynamically caching files for any purpose

Service workers allow us to do things on the web that have typically been reserved for native apps. They'll help us deliver a rich offline experience, schedule reliable background syncs, even handle push notifications. Super neat things.

### Resources to get going 
If you're ready to dive in, do youself a favor and dedicate a few hours to simply **LEARN** before you try to do something snazzy. Get yourself a nice, round understanding of how service workers fit into the web as a whole, and how they can make your project better. [ServiceWorker Cookbook][serviceworke.rs], [html5rocks](html5rocks.com) and [mozilla](developer.mozilla.org) all have some extremelty helpful resources that should get you headed in the right direction fast.
