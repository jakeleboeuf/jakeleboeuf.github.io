I've finally decided it's time to be a big boy and learn more about service workers. Something I should have done a long time ago. So if your like me and have been putting off this new technology, I think it's a great time to get our hands dirty and add a little SW magic to our projects. I've have found the [ServiceWorker Cookbook][serviceworke.rs] to be a really helpful resource, so check them out.

### Service Workers? WTF?
Service workers are a new technology to aid developers in:

- creating realistic, reliable offline experiences
- vastly improving performance when online
- logically and dynamically caching files for any purpose

If you want to dive in, do youself a favor and dedicate a few hours to learning. Get yourself a nice, round understanding of how service workers fit into the web as a whole, and how they can make your project better. [html5rocks](html5rocks.com) and [mozilla](developer.mozilla.org) both have some extremelty helpful resources that should get you headed in the right direction fast.
